# Machine learning Laboratory

## LIST OF ASSIGNMENTS:
1. Compute Estimators of the main statistical measures like Mean, Variance, Standard 
   Deviation, Covariance, Correlation and Standard error with respect to any example. 
   Display grahically the distribution of samples.
2. Plot the Normal Distribution for class test result of a particular subject. Identify the 
   Skewness and Kurtosis
3. Load the dataset: birthwt Risk Factors Associated with Low Infant Birth Weight at 
  https://raw.github.com/neurospin/pystatsml/master/datasets/birthwt.csv
    1. Test the association of mother’s (bwt) age and birth weight using the correlation 
    test and linear regeression.
    2. Test the association of mother’s weight (lwt) and birth weight using the 
    correlation testand linear regeression.
    3. Produce two scatter plot of: (i) age by birth weight; (ii) mother’s weight by birth 
    weight. Elaborate the Conclusion
4. Apply Basic PCA on the iris dataset. The data set is available at: 
   https://raw.github.com/neurospin/pystatsml/master/datasets/iris.csv
    • Describe the data set. Should the dataset been standardized?
    • Describe the structure of correlations among variables.
    • Compute a PCA with the maximum number of components
    .• Compute the cumulative explained variance ratio. Determine the number of 
    components𝐾by your computed values.
    • Print the𝐾principal components directions and correlations of the𝐾principal 
    compo-nents with the original variables. Interpret the contribution of the original 
    variables into the PC.
    • Plot the samples projected into the𝐾first PCs.
    • Color samples by their species.
5. Perform clustering of the iris dataset based on all variables using Gaussian mixture 
    models. Use PCA to visualize clusters.
